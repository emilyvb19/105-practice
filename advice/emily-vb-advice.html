                <h4>Keep at it!</h4>
                <p>Coding is something that can frustrate you a lot! But don't worry, as long as you keep at it and don't give up, you'll get it!</p>

                <p>And it's the best feeling when you figure it out!</p>

                <h4>Practice, practice, practice!</h4>
                <p>Practice will be your friend, trust me. Keep working on your classes and maybe even throw in your own little project! It will only benefit you down the road.</p>

                <p>Schedule time everyday to work towards those coding goals, even if it's just an hour. It will keep you on your toes and you won't have time to forget anything.</p>

                <p>Be patient and kind to yourself, you're learning something new after all!</p>
